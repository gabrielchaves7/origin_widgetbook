## How widgetbook integrates with the design system?
Each component at the design system is represented as a use case at the widgetbook, see **lib/widgetbook/usecase**. When you create a new component on the design system, you need to create a new usecase to display it on the widgetbook. This can be done following the steps:

1. Create the new usecase. You can use origin_icon_usecase.dart as example.
2. Run the command:
    ```flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```
